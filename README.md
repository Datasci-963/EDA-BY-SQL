Project Overview
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to layoffs (layoffs_staging2). The goal is to derive meaningful insights into trends, industries, and companies affected by layoffs.

Key Queries and Insights
Dataset Overview: Retrieved all records to understand the dataset structure.
Max Values: Identified peak layoffs (absolute and percentage).
High Impact Companies: Highlighted companies with 100% layoffs and sorted them by funding.
Trends by Company and Industry: Summarized layoffs by companies and industries to find those most affected.
Time-Based Analysis: Explored layoffs over time, including trends by month and cumulative totals.
Yearly Rankings: Ranked companies by layoffs within each year.
Steps to Run the Queries
Ensure the layoffs_staging2 table is loaded with accurate and up-to-date data.
Execute the queries sequentially or as per the analysis requirements.
Use visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to create charts for trends by month, industry, or company.
Recommendations
Use the monthly trends query to plot a time-series graph of layoffs.
Compare industry aggregates to determine the sectors most vulnerable during economic downturns.
Leverage the rankings query to identify consistently high-layoff companies for further investigation.
